    Backstory("Samus Aran is an intergalactic
    bounty hunter. She lost her parents during a Space Pirate raid on her home planet
    K-2L. Later, Samus was adopted by the mysterious Chozo and taken to Zebes, where
    she was infused with their DNA and raised to become a warrior. Once she reached
    adulthood, Samus joined the Federation Police and served under the Commanding
    Officer Adam Malkovich. Though she ultimately left to become a Bounty Hunter,
    she was nonetheless hired by the Galactic Federation on many occasions. Equipped
    with her cybernetic Power Suit, Samus has become famous for accomplishing missions
    previously thought impossible. Her most renowned achievements are the destruction
    of the Space Pirate base on Zebes, her role in ending the Galactic Phazon crisis,
    her repeated extermination of the Metroid species, and her disobedience of orders
    at the Biologic Space Laboratories research station where she chose to destroy
    the deadly X Parasites rather than turn them over to the Galactic Federation.")
